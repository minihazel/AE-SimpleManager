A simplistic mod manager for the JET AE project developed by hazel. Designed to easily enable/disable toggle mods from a local PC-hosted server.

# Info
This is an AE-exclusive app which allows the user to toggle enable/disable mods on their singleplayer server in just a couple of clicks.

**This app is WIP, and things may break.**

# Usage
Please install [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/download.html) for extracting zipped folders, as WinRAR sometimes doesn't work.
## Extracting
Head over to the [Releases](https://github.com/minihazel/AE-SimpleManager/releases) page and download the latest version of this app. Unpack the zip file anywhere. Move `Mod Manager.exe` into a folder of your choice. Open it.
## Using
Press `BROWSE SERVER` and select the folder which contains your server (Server.exe). Mods on that server will automatically pop up in the list. Clicking on any mod will toggle enable or disable it. There is an active hover-based status which displays if it's enabled or disabled.

# To-do list
**Wanted in future updates**:
* Display server name instead of path in the app titlebar

# Versions
This acts both as a changelog and as a history log. Only the latest version will be available for download. I do not provide support for older versions of my apps.

## 1.0.0
* Initial release
